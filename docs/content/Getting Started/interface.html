            The interface is made to be simple and easy to use with more advanced features hidden around the corner. Lets take a look.
        </p>

        <h2>Sidebar</h2>
        <p>
            The sidebar contains all the main navigation options within the application. It is collapsable and expandable by clicking the hamburger menu icon in the top-left corner.
        </p>

                <img src="assets/docs/sidebar-collapsed.svg" alt="Collapsed Sidebar" class="article-image" width="65px" height="auto">
                <p class="image-caption">Collapsed Sidebar</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Dashboard</h2>
        <p>
            The dashboard is the opening page of the application. It shows you your statistics and the option to jump back into a study session.
        </p>

        
        <p>
            The dashboard is split into two sections;
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>The top section shows your statistics through widgets. You can add or remove widgets by clicking the <img src="assets/docs/Icon_widget.svg" alt="Show widget overlay" class="article-image" width="20px" height="auto"> icon in the top-right corner on the widget section then <img src="assets/docs/Icon_widget_manager.svg" alt="Open Widget Manager" class="article-image" width="auto" height="20"></li>
            <li>The bottom section allows you to jump back into a session by double clicking on the session you want to jump back into. If you right click you get more options such as <strong>Go To</strong>, <strong>Export</strong> and <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Learning Paths -->
        <h2>Learning Paths</h2>
        <p>
            Learning Paths is a great way to study for exams or tests. You can upload any reference materials you want to study from; including PDFs, text files, youtube videos, and more, or simply write a prompt and let the AI generate a learning path for you.
        </p>

        
        <p>
            When the learning path is created, the first thing you will see is the unit overview. Most of them is grayed out, this is because the units are generated as you go. However, if you want to generate them all at once you can press the <strong>Generate All</strong> button, this allows you to also use the paths fully offline.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How To Use The Learning Paths</h3>
        <p>
            Each unit is divided into two sections: <strong>theory</strong> and <strong>practice</strong>. The theory section provides an article explaining the unit's concepts, while the practice options offer various ways to apply that knowledge.
        </p>
        
        <p>A short overview of the practice options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Quiz</strong> - Creates a quiz to test your knowledge based on the unit theory (can be transfered to the quizzes tab)</li>
            <li><strong>Flashcards</strong> - Creates flashcards to help you memorize the unit theory (can be transfered to the flashcards tab)</li>
            <li><strong>Adaptive</strong> - The adaptive tab is a bit different. It is meant to be a more complete and interactive way to learn. It splits up the unity theory into even smaller chunks, then give you a few questions based on what you just read, then repeat the process until you have learned the entireunit.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Notes -->

        <!-- Flashcards -->
        <h2>Flashcards</h2>

        <!-- Games -->
        <h2>Games</h2>
        <p>
            Many studies have shown that games can be a great way to learn. Mnemo has a built-in game system where developers can create games and publish them. These games uses data from the mnemo application through the mnemo api.
        </p>

        
        <div class="info-box">
            <i class="ti ti-info-square-rounded"></i>
            <div>
                Since games can pull from different data sources, not all games will be compatible with your preferred content. For instance, one game might use a flashcard deck, while another could rely on your mind maps.    
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <i class="ti ti-bulb"></i>
            <div>
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you want to create your own game jump to the <a href="#Games">Games</a> section.
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>How To Use The Games</h3>
        <p>
            In our games store, you can easily browse and discover games published to the Mnemo platform. Every game is free to download, and most don't even require an internet connection to play.    
        </p>

        <p>
            To install a game, just click the <strong>Install</strong> button. If you'd like more information before downloading, simply click the <strong>View</strong> button.
        </p>

        <p>
            Got your own games? No problem! You can also import games you've created or downloaded from elsewhere. Just hit the <strong>Import</strong> button in the top-right corner of the store.
        </p>

        <!-- Extensions -->
        <h2>Extensions</h2>
        <p>
            The application is built to be extensible. We did not want a application that was really busy and packed with unwanted features and bloat-ware. This is where the extensions system comes in to play.
        </p>

        <p>
            Extentions is a way to add new features to the application that might not be needed for everyone. For instance, accessibility: not everyone wants or needs text to speech, accessibility fonts etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            The extensions page is almost the same as the games store. You can browse for extentions published to the mnemo store and connect to them in just a single click. You do this by pressing the <strong>Connect</strong> button, and you can view more information about the extention by clicking the <strong>View</strong> button.
        </p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <i class="ti ti-bulb"></i>
            <div>
                <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you want to create your own extension jump to the <a href="#Extensions">Extensions</a> section.
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Settings -->
        <h2>Settings</h2>
        <p>
            The settings page is where you are able to change things about the application. For instance, you can change the theme, language, and all the other settings you might want to change.
        </p>
        <p>The settings menu is seperated into 5 different sections which you can navigate through with the tabs and the secondary sidebar. These sections are: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Apperance</strong> - Change the theme, font, and other apperance settings.</li>
            <li> <strong>Preferences</strong> - Change the preferences for the application.</li>
            <li> <strong>Data & Storage</strong> - Manage your data and storage.</li>
            <li> <strong>About & Support</strong> - Information about the application and support.</li>
