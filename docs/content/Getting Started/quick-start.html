            <h2>2. Take the Tour</h2>
            <p>
                We recommend taking a quick tour of the mnemo interface to get familiar with the key features when first starting out.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>When launching the application for the first time it will ask if you want to take a quick tour. This is recommended to get familiar with the key features, if you are new to the application.</li>
                <li>If you do skip the tour and regret it later, you can always access it from the settings menu under "About & Support"</li>
