MONETIZATION AND PREMIUM SERVICES

While Mnemo's core features remain free and open source, we reserve the right to offer optional premium services designed to enhance user experience and simplify setup processes. These premium services may include:

1. Automated AI Model Configuration
   - Streamlined setup process
   - No manual API key configuration required
   - Automatic updates management

2. Premium AI Model Access
   - Direct access to premium AI models
   - Pre-configured integration
   - Managed updates and maintenance

Users may continue to use all core features of Mnemo without premium services. This includes the ability to configure and manage their own AI models, API keys, and updates independently.

Premium services are offered through a monthly subscription model and are entirely optional. They are designed to provide convenience and simplified management while ensuring that all essential functionality remains freely accessible to all users.
